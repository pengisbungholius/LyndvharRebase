His love is infinite, and his wrath to his enemies total. While those of the Pantheon believe them to be the creators of Beowricke, and the aspects of all life, the Valorian Orthodoxy Church believes Psydon to have forged Beowricke with his own hands, and the representative of everything. He is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. When the Bloodwake came, it was Psydon that single handedly repelled the Archdaemons, and destroyed their armies. It is believed that Psydon currently rests, but will reawaken when he is needed once again."
